## Law Firm Offer Positioning: Sell Outcomes, Not Services

The fastest way to kill a sales call with a partner? Lead with "We do SEO, web design, and some PPC." They don't buy tactics. They buy a calmer intake calendar, fewer junk leads, and proof they won't have to educate another vendor.

Here’s how we structure offers for Chicago firms before we talk pricing.

### 1. Diagnose before you prescribe

Use your discovery call to map:
- Practice areas that actually drive profit.
- Best/worst lead sources.
- Intake roadblocks.

Only then frame the offer: "We help immigration firms turn Google into a steady flow of work visas using our intake + SEO system."

### 2. Package the system, not deliverables

Break your offer into **named modules** (Authority Build, Search Visibility, Intake Ops). Each module should:
- Explain what business problem it solves.
- Spell out the evidence you'll deliver (dashboards, recordings, case studies).
- Tie to timelines (first 30/60/90 days).

### 3. Speak in outcomes

Examples partners care about:
- "+40% increase in qualified calls from the Loop in 90 days."
- "Cut paralegal time on tire-kickers by 25%."
- "Expedited bilingual intake for Pilsen and Little Village."

### 4. Make risk reversal explicit

Include components like:
- Diagnostic upfront, creditable toward engagement.
- Shared Slack channel + weekly Loom updates.
- Exit clause after 90 days if KPIs aren't trending up.

### 5. Update collateral everywhere

- Website headers
- Proposals & scopes
- Email signatures
- GBP descriptions

Keep language consistent so referrals repeat it for you.

**Template:**
> "We help [firm type] turn [channel] into [business outcome] using a [number]-part system that covers [modules]."

Use this on cold outreach, webinars, and especially when training your team. When everyone sells the same promise, closing deals (and delivering on them) becomes simpler.
