## Chicago Map Pack Playbook for Ambitious Law Firms

The firms winning in Chicago right now know that **map pack visibility = phone calls**. Organic rankings are great, but when someone searches “DUI lawyer Logan Square,” the three map results get most clicks. Here’s how we secure and defend those spots.

### 1. Hyper-localize your categories + services

- Primary category should match revenue focus (e.g., *Personal injury attorney* or *Criminal justice attorney*).
- Add service items for the specific neighborhoods and case types you chase.
- Write 150-200 character descriptions per service that include natural language ("Representing cyclists injured on Milwaukee Ave...").

### 2. Build a photo + video cadence

Upload 3-5 new assets weekly:
- Exterior/interior shots tagged with EXIF data (Lat/Long).
- Short vertical videos introducing attorneys, posted as "Video" on GBP.
- Annotate everything with neighborhood references ("South Loop office") in captions.

### 3. Post like a local publication

Weekly posts should include:
- Event recaps ("Presented at the Pilsen tenants clinic")
- Recent wins (avoid dollar figures; highlight outcome types)
- FAQ snippets answering trending questions ("Can I expunge a cannabis charge in Cook County?")

### 4. Automate review requests the right way

- Trigger SMS/email requests immediately after positive interactions.
- Prompt clients to mention neighborhood + practice area ("He helped me after a West Town crash...").
- Rotate which attorney responds so profiles feel human.

### 5. Track rankings by ZIP code

Use tools like **Local Falcon** or **BrightLocal** to monitor grid-based rankings. Chicago SERPs shift drastically between River North and Hyde Park; react with neighborhood-specific content when you drop below position three.

### 6. Don’t ignore citations + mentions

Rebuild or update the basics (BBB, Avvo, FindLaw), but also pursue local citations:
- Chicago Bar Association directory
- Neighborhood chamber of commerce listings
- Sponsorship blurbs on community sites (Little Village/Lakeview)

### 7. Measure what matters

Tie GBP calls/forms back to signed matters. We tag every GBP CTA with UTM parameters and log call recordings in CallRail so partners can hear the lift themselves.

**Checklist for this week**
1. Refresh your GBP description with 750 characters focused on the cases you want in 2026.
2. Schedule three neighborhood-focused posts in advance.
3. Shoot new office photos with geo-tagging enabled on your phone.
4. Set up a Local Falcon scan for the ZIPs that matter most.
