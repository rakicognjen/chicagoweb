## Google Business Profile Updates Chicago Firms Need to Know in 2026

Google keeps nudging GBP toward richer, more localized experiences. Here are the changes rolling out this year and how to adapt fast.

### 1. Neighborhood Signals Weighting (January)

GBP now highlights *micro-areas* like "River North" or "Pilsen" directly under your name. Firms with service descriptions, posts, and reviews that mention those neighborhoods get a ranking bump.

**Action:** Update service descriptions + FAQ posts with the real neighborhoods you servenot just "Chicago." Add them naturally to review request templates.

### 2. 30-Second Vertical Video Slots (February beta)

Short videos now appear above photos on mobile. They autoplay (muted) and drastically increase tap-through rates.

**Action:** Shoot vertical clips introducing attorneys, walking through offices, or summarizing quick FAQs. Upload weekly and use captions for accessibility.

### 3. AI-Powered Summaries (March)

Google is testing AI blurbs that summarize what clients say about you. If reviews over-index on slow response times, thats what prospects will read.

**Action:** Coach clients to mention responsiveness, outcomes, and neighborhoods. Respond quickly to negative reviews with concrete fixes.

### 4. Practice Area Verification (April)

Some legal categories now require proof (bar number, court filings, or website content) before GBP lets you add them as services.

**Action:** Keep a shared folder with licenses + case summaries ready. Were updating schema + landing pages to back up every specialized service.

### 5. Compliance Reminders

Googles legal vertical team flagged these repeat offenders:
- Results-based language without disclaimers.
- Stock photos labeled as "team."
- Shared office addresses without staffed hours.

Keep disclaimers inside posts, use real photos, and list staffed hours only.
