## Ethical AI Disclaimers Every Law Firm Website Needs in 2026

Illinois regulators haven’t banned AI—but they *have* warned firms to be crystal clear whenever automation touches client communications. If your intake chat, document drafting, or research assistant uses AI, add these disclosures to stay safe.

### 1. Intake chat disclosure

Place a short notice near your chat widget:

> "Portions of this chat are assisted by AI. A licensed attorney reviews information before any advice is provided."

Link to your privacy policy explaining data handling and retention.

### 2. Email/form acknowledgement

Add a checkbox to forms:

- "I understand preliminary responses may be automated and will be reviewed by firm staff before engagement."

Track consent in your CRM.

### 3. Website footer statement

Include a single line in the footer:

> "We use secure AI tools for intake triage and drafting support; attorneys supervise all outputs."

### 4. Internal policy summary page

Publish a short "How we use AI" page covering:
- Tools involved
- Human oversight
- Data retention/encryption
- Contact info for questions

### 5. Update your privacy policy

Spell out:
- What data feeds your AI assistants
- Third-party processors
- Opt-out options

### 6. Train your team

Disclaimers only work if staff reinforce them. Add AI talking points to intake scripts and retainer agreements.
