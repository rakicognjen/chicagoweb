## AI Intake Routing for Law Firms Without Losing the Human Touch

Great SEO is wasted if intake collapses. The smartest Chicago firms are using lightweight AI layers to triage form fills and chats before a human ever picks up the phone. Done right, it boosts conversion rates **and** keeps you inside advertising and ethics guardrails.

### 1. Capture richer data at the source

**Dynamic forms** built in Typeform or Paperform can reveal new questions based on a visitor’s practice area selection ("injury type," "incident date," "opposing party"). The goal is to collect enough context so AI can score urgency without punishing legitimate prospects.

### 2. Route leads intelligently

Tools like **Zapier**, **Make**, or **HighLevel** can read form responses, match them to your case-value matrix, and send:

- High-value matters to senior intake with SMS + Slack alerts.
- Medium cases to a shared inbox plus a Calendly link.
- Mismatches to an automated, polite decline email that still offers value (download, referral list, etc.).

### 3. Layer in AI for pre-screening

Use **OpenAI Assistants** or **LangChain**-powered bots to summarize long narratives and flag red/green signals. Keep prompts tight: "summarize, highlight jurisdiction, note red flags." Always show staff the raw submission so humans make the final call.

### 4. Keep compliance on lock

- Include consent language near every form field.
- Log every automated response for auditability.
- Make sure any AI tool stores data in HIPAA/ABA-friendly environments (or use self-hosted options).

### 5. Close the loop with reporting

Feed call recordings + CRM outcomes back into your SEO dashboards. When you learn that motorcycle cases from Cicero convert 3x better, the content team knows what to prioritize next.
